## Onion Relational Mapping

OnionRM is an ORM for node.js targeting Postgres. OnionRM owes it's existence to [node-orm2](https://github.com/dresende/node-orm2) from which OnionRM forked.

## Only Postgres?

_Aren't ORMs supposed to be database agnostic?_

Many, and perhaps most, are. But, at the end of the day you've chosen Postgres for a reason. Postgres has many awesome features, and shouldn't your application make use of them?

Features like JSON, Arrays are natively supported.

# Getting Started

To get started, initialize a connection to Postgres;

```js
var orm = require('onionrm');

orm.connect("postgres://user@localhost/database", function(err, db){
	//define models

	//perform database operations here

	db.close() //close connection
};
```

## Models

Like all other ORMs, OnionRM lets your define models. Models can be defined after connecting to Postgres and acquiring a database object;

```js

var Customer = db.define("customers", {
	created_at      : Date,
	updated_at      : Date,
	username        : String,
	password_hash   : String,
	name            : String
});

//class level methods can be defined like this;
Customer.withUsernameAndPassword = function(username, password, callback){
	var hash = calculateAHash(password);
	var filter = {
		username: username,
		password_hash: hash
	};
	this.find(filter, callback);
};

var Order = db.define("orders", {
	created_at      : Date,
	updated_at      : Date,
	number          : String,
	status_code     : Number,
	customer_id     : String
}, {
	methods: {
		//define instance methods here
		statusDescription: function () {
			switch(this.status_code){
					case 1:
						return "Processing";
					case 2:
						return "Shipped";
					case 3:
						return "Cancelled";
					default:
						return "Pending";
			}
		}
	}
});

Order.hasOne "customer", Customer

```

## Creating Models

To create/save an instance of a method, pass a hash into the `create` method;

```js
var details = {
	number: "123-abc",
	customer_id: "435cb549-8d10-4137-8e60-67c6f6204c7e"
};

Order.create(details, function(err, order){
	//other tasks
});

```

Upon successful persistance of the created instance, a model instance will be returned.

## Updating Models

With a reference to an OnionRM model, you can then perform an update. To update an model, mutate it's state, and then call `save`;

```js
order.status_code = 2;
order.save(function(err){

});
```

Models expose an `isDirty` method for checking if anything has actually changed since the last time it was saved.

```js
order.isDirty(); //false
order.status_code = 2;
order.isDirty(); //true (assuming status_code previously was not 2, false otherwise)
order.save(function(err){

});
```

## Deleting Models

Deletes can be performed in a similar fashion. Simply call `remove` on an OnionRM model instance;

```js
order.remove(function(err){

});
```

## Chain Find

With the basics of how to create, update, or delete models out of the way, let's look at how to fetch existing models.

Fetching data starts with `ChainFind`, a chainable querying builder. The simplest query is `find`;

```js
Order.find({number: "456-zyx"}, function(err, orders){

};
```

The above is similar to writing the following SQL:

```sql
select id, created_at, updated_at, number, status_code, customer_id
from orders
where number='456-zyx';
```

_Note: Any SQL shown in this document is simply for illustration purposes. The actual SQL generated by OnionRM is slightly different, and can even vary based upon which ChainFind operators are performed (e.g. to help resolve ambiguous columns, etc)._

The first parameters to `find` is a hash of properties to "filter" by. As illustrated above they're simple equalities, as as we'll see later many more operators are available.

_Note: It's worth pointing out that if only one item is expected, the `one` method can be used instead. It behaves exactly like `find`, and is chainable, but only returns the first matching record._

Additional keys/values in the filter hash are ANDed together. So, this;

```js
Order.find({customer_id: "435cb549-8d10-4137-8e60-67c6f6204c7e", status_code: 3}, function(err, orders){

});
```
Is similar to;
```sql
select id, created_at, updated_at, number, status_code, customer_id
from orders
where customer_id='435cb549-8d10-4137-8e60-67c6f6204c7e'
	and status_code=3;
```

Since this is a chainable query builder, we don't have to stop here. Omitting the callback parameter to `find` allows for almost limitless queries. Since all* chainable actions are valid for `find` as well as `one`, for the remainder of this section we'll just used the variable `chain` to represent either. Similar to;

```js
var chain = Order.find();
//or
var chain = Order.one();
```

### Limit/Offset

When working against large datasets, it's useful to paginate through records;

```js
Order.find().limit(100).offset(1000).run(function(err, orders){

});
```
```sql
select id, created_at, updated_at, number, status_code, customer_id
from orders
limit 100
offset 1000;
```

Of course, offset is required to use limit. If you only cared about the first 500 orders in a particular status, you could;

```js
Order.find({status_code: 1}).limit(500).fun(function(err, orders){

});
```
```sql
select id, created_at, updated_at, number, status_code, customer_id
from orders
where status_code=1
limit 500;
```

### Order

Continuing with the above example, let's say you wanted to find the 500 most recent orders in a status.

```js
Order.find({status_code: 1}).limit(500).order("-created_at").run(function(err, orders){

});
```
```sql
select id, created_at, updated_at, number, status_code, customer_id
from orders
where status_code=1
order by created_at desc
limit 500;
```

As in you can see in the above example, the order of limit and order is irrelevant. The generated SQL will be syntactically correct, since the SQL isn't generated (or ran) until the `fun` function is called.

To find the 500 _oldest_ orders in a specific status, remove the negative sign in front of the sort property;


```js
Order.find({status_code: 1}).limit(500).order("created_at").run(function(err, orders){

});
```
```sql
select id, created_at, updated_at, number, status_code, customer_id
from orders
where status_code=1
order by created_at
limit 500;
```

### Join/With

Filtering on the values of a specific model can only get you so far, however many times we want to find items based on their relationship to other items. This is where `join` and `with` come in.

By itself, join simply joins one model to another;
```js
LineItem.find({product_code: 'ZZZ123'}).join("orders", "id", "order_id").run(function(err, lineItems){

});
```
```sql
select --properties in line item model
from line_items
join orders on order_id=orders.id
where line_items.product_code = 'ZZZ123';
```

To specify filters on a joined model, use `with`;
```js
LineItem.find({product_code: 'ZZZ123'}).join("orders", "id", "order_id").with({status_code: 3}).run(function(err, lineItems){

});
```
```sql
select --properties in line item model
from line_items
join orders on order_id=orders.id
where line_items.product_code = 'ZZZ123'
	and orders.status_code = 3;
```

The `with` operator is slightly different from other `ChainFind` methods in that it's applied _only_ to the immediately preceding `join`. This permits multiple models to be joined, without ambiguity of model property names. For example;

```js
LineItem.find({product_code: 'ZZZ123'}).join("orders", "id", "order_id").with({created_at: orm.gt(thisYear)}).join("customers", "id", "customer_id").with({created_at: orm.lt(thisYear)}).run(function(err, lineItems){

});
```
```sql
select --properties in line item model
from line_items
join orders on order_id=orders.id
join customers on customer_id=customers.id
where line_items.product_code = 'ZZZ123'
	and orders.created_at > '2015-01-01T00:00:00Z'
	and customers.created_at < '2015-01-01T00:00:00Z';

```

_The `orm.gt` and `orm.lt` operators will be discussed in detail in the section below._


### Only/Omit

By default OnionRM retrieves all (and only) the properties specified in a model's definition when querying Postgres. In the example "order" model, all our SQL has explicitly selected specific fields;

```sql
select id, created_at, updated_at, number, status_code, customer_id
from orders
--etc
```

This allows for database columns to exist, that aren't mapped into a model (and thusly aren't fetched). But, it also allows for fields to be blacklisted/whitelisted on demand using `only` and `omit`.

Perhaps you're exposing orders via an API, and you'd rather not expose `status_code`. You could blacklist it using `omit`;

```js
Order.find(filter).omit("status_code").run//....
```

Alternatively you could whitelist which properties you do want expose using `only`;

```js
Order.find(filter).only(["id", "created_at", "number", "customer_id"]).run//....
```

### As JSON

All the examples so far have executed the `ChainFind` by invoking `run`. The `run` method instantiates models, and returns an array of OnionRM models.

In scenarios where you're just fetching models to turn right around and serialize them to JSON, it might make sense to have Postgres directly handle the serialization for you;

```js
Order.find().join("customers", "customer_id", "id").with({name: "Fred"}).omit("status_code").limit(100).asJson(function(err, json){

});
```
```sql
select array_to_json(array_agg(t))::text as json from (
	select
		orders.id,
		orders.created_at,
		orders.updated_at,
		orders.number, orders.
		customer_id
	from orders
	join customers on orders.customer_id=customers.id
	where customers.name='Fred'
	limit 100
) t;
```

The `asJson` method can be used anywhere `run` would have been used, and it's second parameters (called `json` in the above example) is string containing JSON - useful for directly handing off to Express (or other).


## Comparators

So far we've seen filters that query on equality. However, many more operators are available.

### Not Equals

```js
var filter = {
	status_code: orm.ne(1)
};
Order.find(filter, function(err, orders){

});
```
Is similar to;
```sql
select id, created_at, updated_at, number, status_code, customer_id
from orders
where status_code <> 1;
```

To keep the remainder of these comparators concise, only the relevant section of code will be illustrated.

### Greater Than

```js
created_at: orm.gt(aDate)
```
```sql
created_at > '2015-01-01T06:00:00Z'
```

### Greater Than Or Equal
```js
created_at: orm.gte(aDate)
```
```sql
where created_at >= '2015-01-01T06:00:00Z'
```

### Less Than
```js
created_at: orm.lt(aDate)
```
```sql
where created_at < '2015-01-01T06:00:00Z'
```

### Less Than Or Equal
```js
created_at: orm.lte(aDate)
```
```sql
where created_at <= '2015-01-01T06:00:00Z'
```

### In
```js
status_code: [1, 2, 3]
```
```sql
where status_code in (1, 2, 3)
```

### Not In
```js
status_code: orm.not_in([1, 2, 3])
```
```sql
where status_code not in (1, 2, 3)
```

### Between
```js
created_at: orm.between(aDate, anotherDate)
```
```sql
where created_at between '2015-01-01T06:00:00Z' and '2015-02-01T06:00:00Z'
```

### Any
The `ANY` operator compares a literal value for equality to any element in an array.

```js
favorite_foods: orm.any('cookies')
```
```sql
where favorite_foods =ANY('cookies')
```

### Modulo
```js
age: orm.mod(4)
```
```sql
where age % 4
```

## Model Reconstitution
You can reconstitute an OnionRM model by calling the `reconstitute` class method with a hash of the instance's properties;

```js
Customer.reconstitute({name: "Sue"}, function(err, model){

});
```

It's like soup!

## Anything Else?

Sure, there are tons of awesome features OnionRM inherited from [node-orm2](https://github.com/dresende/node-orm2). However, unless it's outlined in this readme, it's subject to removal as existing code is refactored and Postgres specific functionality is added.

Get in and explore! If there's anything super awesome, submit a pull request, even if it's just to document said feature.
